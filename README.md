# Welcome to IT114 Repo
#### I recently started to reorganize all the content so it's easier to go through. 
#### There are still some things I need to work on, but for the most part the major items have been taken care of.
#### Instead of everything being in one branch I have divided up the projects/content into their own specific branches.

Right now you're here at the main branch (by default you all will have master branch).
This will be your hub or table of contents.
As of this writing, I still have Fall2019 Branch, Spring2020 Branch, and Master Branch (which is more or less Spring2020).

Here's the new table of contents:
